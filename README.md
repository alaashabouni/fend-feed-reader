# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

This application uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) testing.

My goal was to include tests that ensured the following:

- Each feed entry had a name and a URL
- The hamburger menu functioned properly when clicked
- Each feed load in unique and not duplicate of an earlier feed load
